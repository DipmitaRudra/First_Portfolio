## About This Portfolio
This is my **first ever portfolio website**! I’m still a beginner at web development, so don’t judge my CSS too harshly 😅. It showcases my professional profile, skills, and projects in a **modern, responsive, and interactive** design.

## How I Built It
- **Technologies Used:** HTML, CSS, SCSS, JavaScript  
- **Animations & Effects:** Glowing borders, smooth hover effects, and interactive placeholders  
- **Icons & Fonts:** Boxicons, Font Awesome  
- **Layout:** Flexbox and CSS Grid for responsive design  
- **Backgrounds:** Blended section backgrounds with transparent content cards  
- **Interactivity:** Smooth scrolling and button links to sections  

Everything was hand-coded by yours truly, without using any frontend frameworks — because I like to keep things lightweight and (sometimes) complicated.
